            <p>
                Hello, fellow Babylon 5 enthusiasts! My name is Christopher Duong, and I'm the creator of this fan website dedicated to one of the greatest sci-fi series of all time â€“ Babylon 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a long-time fan of the show, I decided to build this website to share my passion and create a space where fans can come together to celebrate the iconic characters, thrilling episodes, and the rich universe that is Babylon 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is also my Final Project so i decided to do it on my favorite sci-fi series.
