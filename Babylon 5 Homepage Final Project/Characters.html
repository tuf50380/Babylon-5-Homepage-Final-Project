            <div class="character-card">
                <img src="./Character images/JefferySinclair.jpeg" alt="Jeffery Sinclair played by Michael O'Hare">
                <h3>Commander Jeffrey Sinclair</h3>
                <p>
                    The first commanding officer of Babylon 5. 
                    The commander of Babylon 5 and representative of the Earth Alliance. 
                    A survivor of the climactic Battle of the Line at the end of the Earth-Minbari War, Sinclair sometimes yearns for his days as a hotshot fighter pilot, and partially for that reason, he's given to taking unnecessary personal risks. 
                    He's uncomfortable in his position and in fact isn't entirely sure why he was given command of such a major post and made a high-level diplomat; his stiff demeanor is perhaps due to a fear that he isn't up to the job he's been given. 
                    Sinclair was born on Mars Colony and is 39 years old.

            <div class="character-card">
                <img src="./Character images/JohnSheridan.jpeg" alt="John Sheridan played Bruce Boxleitner">
                <h3>Captain John Sheridan</h3>
                <p>
                    The second commanding officer of Babylon 5.
                    The commander of Babylon 5 and representative of the Earth Alliance. 
                    One of Earth's few war heros, Sheridan scored the only major victory against the Minbari during the war, something which has earned him the hatred of the Minbari warrior caste. 
                    Generally jovial, occasionally serious, Sheridan was hand-picked by the President to replace Sinclair. 
                    Sheridan is still recovering from the loss of his wife Anna, who died on an alien archaeological dig. 
                    Most of his career has been spent aboard starships; he's still in the process of getting used to being the head of what is essentially a small city in space. 
                    Sheridan and Ivanova have served together in the past.

                <img src="./Character images/AfterDelennChange.jpeg"  alt="Delenn after her Transformation played by Mira Furlan">
                <h3>Ambassador Delenn</h3>
                <p>
                    Represents the Minbari Federation. Delenn is a member of the highest Minbari governmental body, the Grey Council, and why she's masquerading as a lowly ambassador is one of the ongoing mysteries of Babylon 5. 
                    A member of the religious caste, Delenn's belief in fate and destiny is often evident. 
                    She is fascinated by humans and tries to learn all about them; some say she is suspiciously watchful of Commander Sinclair.

            <div class="character-card">
                <img src="./Character images/MichaelGaribaldi.jpeg" alt="Michael Garibaldi Babylon 5 Security Chief">
                <h3>Michael Garibaldi</h3>
                <p>
                    In charge of security on Babylon 5. 
                    He has a troubled past, bouncing from position to position and trying to overcome alcoholism. 
                    He was picked by Sinclair for the job; the two worked together in the past. 
                    Sinclair knew that Garibaldi would be persistent, not willing to give in to political pressures -- in Sinclair's words, "a pain in the ass." 
                    Garibaldi is something of a smart-aleck, always ready to crack a joke, but given to bouts of self-doubt and introspection when nobody's looking. 
                </p>

            <div class="character-card">

                <h3>Susan Ivanova</h3>
                <p>
                    Second in command and in charge of the day-to-day operations of Babylon 5, Ivanova is an ambitious career officer. 
                    She can be quirky or pessimistic at times, but she has a dry sense of humor that shows itself in the rare moments she is able to relax among others. 
                    Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, and raised abroad on Earth, she has a strong dislike for the Psi-Corps, whose legally-mandated drug treatments drove her mother to suicide after it was discovered her mother was a latent telepath. 
                    She is new on the station and often buries herself in her work; her friends are few and her family is all but gone.

                <h3>Stephen Franklin</h3>
                <p>
                    Babylon 5 Chiefs Medical Officer
                    Dedicated and assured, a specialist in xenobiology (alien biology,) and in charge of Medlab on Babylon 5. 
                    His background is mainly in experimental medicine, so his bedside manner is occasionally not what it should be. 
                    His strong sense of personal morality is at times in conflict with his duties as the chief medical provider for aliens from hundreds of worlds and cultures, some of whom view his obligations rather differently. 
                    In his middle thirties now, he spent years hitchhiking through space, offering his doctoral services in exchange for the opportunity to examine new life forms.

            <div class="character-card">
                <img src="./Character images/LondoMollari.jpeg" alt="Ambassador Londo Mollari played by Peter Jurasik">
                <h3>Ambassador Londo Mollari</h3>
                <p>
                    Centauri Republic Ambassador Assigned to Babylon 5
                    The representative of the Centauri Republic. 
                    Londo views Babylon 5's mission as something of a sham, with limited chance of helping his people regain their lost glory and sense of purpose. 
                    His assignment on Babylon 5 is not considered an important position, in spite of the high status that his regalia and high-standing hair would indicate. 
                    A war hero in his younger days, he has since grown decadent and indulgent. 
                    Londo can often be found in one of the station's bars or casinos, drinking himself to oblivion. 
                    He has a biting, cynical sense of humor. Perhaps his only real friend is Garibaldi, who understands something of what Londo has been through.
                </p>

            <div class="character-card">
                <img src="./Character images/Gkar.jpeg" alt="Ambassador G'Kar played by Andreas Katsulas">
                <h3>Ambassador G'Kar</h3>
                <p>
                    Narn Regime Ambassador Assigned to Babylon 5
                    The representative of the Narn Regime rose to his position in part thanks to his wife's renown as a hero of the revolutionary war against the Centauri, but his own ambition and ability are more than equal to the job. 
                    G'Kar will waste no opportunity to turn a situation to the Narns' advantage, even if it means antagonizing everyone else on the station. 
                    He takes pride in his position and himself, a pride perhaps bordering on arrogance at times. 
                    G'Kar would like nothing better than to see the Centauri, and Londo in particular, pay dearly for their brutal occupation of Narn.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="character-card">
                <img src="./Character images/Kosh.jpeg" alt="Ambassador Kosh Naranel">
                <h3>Ambassador Kosh</h3>
                <p>
                    Vorlon Ambassador Assigned to Babylon 5
                    Even less is known about Ambassador Kosh than about his race. 
                    He arrived on the station in 2257 and was promptly the victim of a complex assassination plot involving the Minbari and others. 
                    He is rarely seen in council meetings, claiming that "we take no interest in the affairs of others," and Vorlons' reasons for coming to Babylon 5 at all are unknown. 
                    Kosh communicates through a complex sequence of musical tones, translated into English by a device on his encounter suit. 
                    When he speaks, his words are few and sound cryptic, but often have a strange truth to them. 
                    Kosh's quarters are filled with a dense atmosphere of methane and other gases; whether he needs it or is using it to make himself less accessible is an open question. 
                    Even when he's receiving visitors there, Kosh wears his suit.

                <h3>Vir Cotto</h3>
                <p>Centauri assistant to Londo. Timid, unsure of himself, at times he seems little more than someone for Londo to throw things at.</p>

                <h3>Lennier</h3>
                <p>
                    Delenn's aide, fresh out of a monastery on the Minbari homeworld. 
                    He's something of an innocent abroad, perhaps the one person on Babylon 5 without a hidden agenda or a knife waiting to stab someone in the back. 
                    He reveres Delenn; to him she's a holy figure.</p>

                <h3>Talia Winters</h3>
                <p>
                    Babylon 5's resident telepath, on her first solo assignment, with level 5 psi rating, bound by the rules and regulations of the Psi Corps. 
                    She sells her telepathic services to businessmen and occasionally assists the station personnel. 
                    Talia was raised and trained by the Psi Corps, meaning that that organization is her family.</p>

                <h3>Lyta Alexander</h3>
                <p>
                    Lyta was Babylon 5's first commercial telepath, rating P5, in her early thirties or late twenties. 
                    She was transferred off the station shortly after examining Kosh, presumably due to her newfound knowledge of the Vorlons

                <h3>Bester</h3>
                <p>
                    A Psi-Cop, one of an elite unit of the Psi Corps whose function is to track down rogue telepaths, among other things. 
                    Perhaps in part because of his P12 psi rating -- more than twice as high as Talia's -- he seems to have risen to a position of some importance in the Corps. 
                    Bester ruthlessly pursues his agenda, which most of the time is the same as the Corps'.
