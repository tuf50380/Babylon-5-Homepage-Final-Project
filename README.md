I had a lot of fun making this since this involved my favorite Scifi Series. There were some challenges like remembering all the HTML/CSS/Javascript that i learned a while ago. The Html was easy to pick up and do and the only annoying thing is the repetitive nature of copy and pasting the info. CSS was a little hard because i am not good at designing and choosing good color and making it fancy. The gallery page took a while because i was trying to do a hover and the image changes but it wasn't working for me. I changed it to a rotating gallery that comes from the left side of the page and some of the pictures are a little low quality. Javascript i barely touched but i did wanted to do more with all the pages to be more interactive but it wasn't working for me and Javascript i have so little stuff i remember from Javascript that is why there is barely any javascript beside some stuff for the gallery
