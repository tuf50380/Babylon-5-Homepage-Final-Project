## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Babylon 5 Home Page Project 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A website dedicated to my favorite 90's tv show Babylon 5. It will hopefully an informative website to let more people learn about the greatest tv show before GOT and deals with themes that feel real today.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will be a front end homepage with the standard HTML/CSS/Javascript that will have tabs to get you to their bio and other informative information about them.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Creating a simple homepage with at least working links and try to do as much as i can with the allotted time.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Whole site wide interactivity and maybe some special surprise for people who love Babylon 5

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Relearning HTML/CSS/Javascript is a neccessity as is python because knowledge is power and it will expand my toolset and hopefully make me a better programmer.
